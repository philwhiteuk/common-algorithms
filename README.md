# common-algorithms

> WARNING! this is a shameless fork of [ThePrimeagen/kata-machine](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/kata-machine) and there is also a great free online course to go with it

I published this to demonstrate that at some point I took the time to learn about these common algorithms and had a go at implementing them myself.

This is a reference and meant as a reminder of how each one works - the code examples included are NOT meant to be used in any other way than that. 

## Kata

To have a go at implementing one of these yourself

    git clone git@github.com:philwhiteuk/common-algorithms.git
    npm i
    git checkout start 'src/LinearSearch*'

## Tests

To run all tests

    npm run test

To run a specific test - e.g. LinearSearchList

    npm run test -- LinearSearch
